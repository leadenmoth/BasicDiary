# BasicDiary
Basic diary app for Android
Basic Diary uses SQLite to store diary records (title, text, date created and date modified). The project contains 4 activities: main (list of all diaries), browse (single diary view), edit (editing single diary) and settings. You can create, edit and delete diaries. Modified timestamp is updated on every save. Main menu has a sort option (by title, date created or date modified). Settings menu allows to set default sorting with which the app will start next time. Long press in the diary list to get a context menu to delete. Tap delete in browse view to delete. The project uses material design styles with snackbars, floating action buttons and toolbar overflows. Settings activity is implemented with fragments. Minimum API should be 15, though target SDK during development was 23, and it uses some 26 features.
